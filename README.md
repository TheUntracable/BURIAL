Hello! Welcome to the BURIAL program! We will walk you through everything you need to know.

NOTE: Sadly, our decrypter has been deleted. This will take a while to re-make. Our apologies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO WE ARE:
Hello! We're an organization focused on software development, and we've recently discovered our shared interest in malware and ethical hacking.
We explore new ways to uncover the potential of Linux and Windows systems, this tool is a decrypting and encrypting tool.
We hope this gives you a clearer idea of who we are.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT WE ARE DESIGNING:
We are currently focusing on creating malicious software, decrypting and encrypting from basically zero experience with Linux. 
This file tool is a DECRYPTING AND ENCRYPTING tool (maliscious software is a future project) to test files. (this file only encrypts 3 test files that are also automatically made. If you'd like to test this on all files we recommend trying these test files first. 
This might sound strange and impossible at first, but we believe we've come a long way and are ready for the design phase. 
Our goal is to develop malware capable of capturing information from a laptop, computer, or PC to test the target's security and online safety.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
The phrase "harming the target" is used hypothetically. This mtool has NO INTENTION of harming actual people. Using malware to steal information is ILLEGAL and UNETHICAL! This program is designed to test security and safety measures, NOT to harm others.

INSTALL:
""burial program is still being designed, install is currently available but it's likely to have errors.""
