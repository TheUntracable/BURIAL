Hello! Welcome to the BURIAL program! We will walk you through everything you need to know.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO WE ARE:
Hello! We're an organization focused on software development, and we've recently discovered our shared interest in malware and ethical hacking.
We explore new ways to uncover the potential of Linux and Windows systems, with the goal of creating malicious software designs to test basic security. 
We hope this gives you a clearer idea of who we are.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT WE ARE DESIGNING:
We are currently focusing on creating malicious software (malware) from basically zero experience with Linux. 
This might sound strange and impossible at first, but we believe we've come a long way and are ready for the design phase. 
Our goal is to develop malware capable of capturing information from a laptop, computer, or PC to test the target's security and online safety.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:
The phrase "harming the target" is used hypothetically. This malware has NO INTENTION of harming actual people. Using malware to steal information is ILLEGAL and UNETHICAL! This program is designed to test security and safety measures, NOT to harm others.
